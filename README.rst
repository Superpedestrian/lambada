A `flask <http://flask.pocoo.org>`_ like framework for building
multiple lambdas in one library/package by utilizing `lambda-uploader
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lambda-uploader>`_.

Quickstart
==========


All you'll need to do to create a minimal lambada application is to
add the following to a file called ``lambda.py`` :

.. code-block:: python

    from lambada import Lambada

    tune = Lambada(role='arn:aws:iam:xxxxxxx:role/lambda')


    @tune.dancer
    def test_lambada(event, context):
        print('Event: {}'.format(event))

and a ``requirements.txt`` file that includes the lambada package
(either ``lambada`` or ``https://github.com/Superpedestrian/lambada``
for the latest release or developer version respectively.

Much like a flask app, we now have a python file that is configured to
upload a lambda function with the name ``test_lambada`` in your AWS
account in the ``us-east-1`` region (since that is the default), and
the handler will be set to ``lamda.tune``, again the default.

So what is this doing over just writing the same thing without this framework?

For one it gives you a command line toolset to test, list, and publish
multiple functions to AWS as independant Lambda's with one code base.

Now that you have your code, you can run the ``lambada`` command line
tool after running ``pip install -r requirements.txt`` to do something
like ``lambada list``

::

    List of discovered lambda functions/dancers:

    test_lambada:
        description:

You can also test that lambda with an event passed on the command line
using ``lambada run test_lambada --event 'Hello'`` to get:

::

    Event: Hello

which creates a faked AWS Context object before running the specified
*dancer*.

From there we can also package the functions (the same package works
for all defined *dancers*/Lambda functions).  So without configuring
any AWS credentials, we can run ``lambada package`` to create a zip
file with all your requirements packaged up (from the earlier created
``requirements.txt``) that you can manually upload to AWS Lambda
through the Web interface or similar.

If you have your AWS API credentials setup, and the correct
permissions, you can also run ``lambada upload`` to have the function
created and/or versioned with the packaged code for each *dancer*.

Pretty neat so far, but where it starts to get cool is when there are
many *dancers* with different requirements, VPCs, timeouts, security
configuration, and memory requirements all in the same deployable
package similar to the following.  We're going to go ahead and call
our file ``fouronthefloor.py`` just as a reference for the
customization you can do, so the contents of ``fouronthefloor.py``
would look like:

.. code-block:: python

    from lambada import Lambada

    chart = Lambada(
        handler='fouronthefloor.chart',
        role='arn:aws:iam:xxxxxxx:role/lambda',
        region='us-west-2',
        timeout=60,
        memory=128
    )


    @chart.dancer
    def test_lambada(event, context):
        print('Event: {}'.format(event))


    @chart.dancer(
        name='not_the_function_name',
        description='Cool description',
        memory=512,
        region='us-east-1',
        requirements=['requirements.txt', 'xtra_requirements.txt']
    )
    def cool_oneoff(event, context):
        print('Wow, so much memory! in a diff region and extra reqs!')


    @chart.dancer(memory=1024, timeout=5)
    def bob_loblaw(event, _):
        print('Such a great reference!')

Which gives a ``lambada list`` that looks like:

::

    List of discovered lambda functions/dancers:

    bob_loblaw:
        description:
        timeout: 5
        memory: 1024

    test_lambada:
        description:

    not_the_function_name:
        description: Cool description
        region: us-east-1
        requirements: ['requirements.txt', 'xtra_requirements.txt']
        memory: 512
                
And with a few lines we've created three lambdas with different execution
requirements all with one ``lambada upload`` command. Such a simple
seductive dance ðŸ˜œ.

Bouncers
========

AWS Lambda doesn't yet feature a way to add secure configuration items
through environment variables (if it ever will), but there is often a
need to have secrets that you don't want checked into source control
such as API keys, passwords, certificates, etc.  Generally it is nice
to specify these with an out of source tree configuration file or
environment variables. To achieve that here, we have the concept of
``Bouncer`` objects.  This configuration object is created by default
when you instantiate the ``Lambada`` class with a default configuration
that you can use out of the box.  The default
:py:obj:`lambada.Bouncer` object looks for YAML configuration files in
the following paths:

- Path specified by the environment variable ``BOUNCER_CONFIG``
- The current working directory for ``lambada.yml``
- Your ``HOME`` directory for ``.lambada.yml``
- ``/etc/lambada.yml``

and it does so in that order, terminating as soon as it successfully finds one.


In addition to those configuration files, it also will automatically
add any variable prefixed with ``BOUNCER_`` (again default, and can be
changed to an arbitrary prefix) to the bouncer configuration.  This
means that without any code you can add configuration to your Lambada
project by just adding say ``BOUNCER_API_KEY`` to your local
configuration and referencing it in your code as
``tune.bouncer.api_key`` (assuming ``tune`` is the variable you chose
for your lambada class.

Similarly, if you define a ``lambada.yml`` configuration file that looks like:

.. code-block:: yaml

   api_key: 1234abcd

it will be accessible in the same way as ``tune.bouncer.api_key``.

It is worth noting that the environment variable will override the
same named variable in your yaml file.

How this works in Lamda is that the Bouncer configuration on the
Lambada is read when packaged for AWS and written to a _lambada.yml
configuration and is looked for first when running in Lambda.


Customizing Bouncers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If those defaults don't work for you, you can also pass in your own
``Bouncer`` to the ``Lambada`` object on creation. It allows you to directly pass in the path to the configuration and/or change the environment variable prefix like so:

.. code-block:: python

   from lambada import Bouncer, Lambada

   bouncer = Bouncer(config_file='foobar.yml', env_prefix='COOL_')
   tune = Lambada(bouncer=bouncer, role=bouncer.role)

   @tune.dancer
   def test_lambada(event, context):
       print(bouncer.role)

as an example, which lets you use bouncer to help configure the ``Lambada`` object
